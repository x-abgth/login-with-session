# Login Application (uses session and cookies)
This is a simple web application to learn about session and cookies in Golang (go). The app uses [**gorilla web toolkit**](https://www.gorillatoolkit.org/) for http functions and also uses [**html/template**](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) package to display html files dynamically.
- The application is completely responsive using bootstrap.
- The application uses cache-control to prevent un-necessary routing.
- The application is easy to understand and is well documented.
